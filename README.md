# take-home-exercises

My solutions to the following take home excersizes:

## Python + Numpy
(These can be found under /project )
Please write not only an implementation, but also a basic test for each of these problems (with pytest).
Feel free to search the numpy and python docs, blog posts etc, but please avoid ChatGPT and looking up solutions to these problems.

0. Given a two dimensional array, how to extract unique rows? 
1. From a 10x3 matrix extract rows with unequal values (e.g. [2,2,3])
2. How to compute ((A+B)*(-A/2)) in place (without copy)?
3. Given an integer n and a 2D array X, select from X the rows which can be interpreted as draws from a multinomial distribution with n degrees, i.e., the rows which only contain integers and which sum to n.
4. Consider a large vector Z, compute Z to the power of 3 using 3 different methods
5. How to get the n largest values of an array
6. Compute a matrix rank
7. How to compute averages using a sliding window over an array?

## Fortran
0. Write a small program to create a random array of integers between 0 and 10000, of length 10000, and produce the (n=8) largest values
1. From a 10x3 random matrix (numbers between 0 and 5) extract rows with unequal values (e.g. [2,2,3]) and print them to the screen

Other Fortran excercizes were taken from the following [course](https://wvuhpc.github.io/Modern-Fortran/).
